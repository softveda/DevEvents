## Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ

### My event is not listed/wrongly classified/there is a mistake

No problem - please see [**How do I Contribute**](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details of how you can fix this, or add an issue and we'll look into it.

If an event is not listed, it might be that the event isn't sufficiently targeted at developers. If you disagree, open an issue and state your case. We're happy to find out more.

### What type of events will get listed

We're looking for events that match the following basic criteria:

- _It's an Australian based event, run anytime from 2016 onwards_
- _It's of interest to the software development community_

It doesn't matter if it's free or not, and we don't care if it's an in-person event or a virtual one. As long as it meets the criteria, we're happy!

### This should be done using RSS/ATOM/Microformat/JSON/Blockchain etc

This resource is only as good as people's contributions so we want to make it as easy as possible for people to make changes. Markdown in conjunction with GitHub markdown editor makes it very easy for anyone to modify the content, even without tooling. Feel free to build something cool based on this data.
